Methods and arrangements for emulating a data center network. A first end host and a second end host are provided. A base hypervisor is associated with each of the first and second end hosts, and the first and second end hosts are interconnected. A virtual hypervisor is associated with at least one virtual machine running on at least one of the base hypervisors, and virtual hypervisors are interconnected within one of the first and second end hosts. A virtual machine is nested within the virtual hypervisor, and the virtual machine is migrated from one virtual hypervisor to a destination virtual hypervisor to further be nested within the destination virtual hypervisor.
