Methods and arrangements for facilitating virtual machine migration across data centers. A virtual machine is designated for migration from a first data center to a second data center, the virtual machine including a real identifier. A pseudo identifier is assigned to the virtual machine, and the pseudo identifier is mapped to the real identifier at a controller of the first data center. The real identifier is replaced in a data packet with the pseudo identifier for a routing task. Communication is maintained between the controller of the first data center and a controller of the second data center, and the controllers are synchronized to update a correct location of the virtual machine. The virtual machine is migrated from the first data center to the second data center.
