Methods and arrangements for detecting and diagnosing system outages. A system outage is ascertained and aberrant user activities are categorized, as possible contributors to the system outage, based on system impact. User activities and system impact are learned, and user activities and system impact are compared against predetermined rules. A system outage alert is generated, and a user activity responsible for the system outage is displayed.
