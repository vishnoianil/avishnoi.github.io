I am Computer Engineer by profession and currently working as a Principal Software Engineer with Brocade R&D, US. I am
also an active contributor to Open Source Projects like <a href="https://www.opendaylight.org">OpenDaylight</a> and <a href="https://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack</a>. I am associated with OpenDaylight project since the inception of the
project. I am an active contributor to the number of OpenDaylight projects including the OpenDaylight Controller,
OpenFlow Plugin,  OVSDB & Net-Virt project. My contributions to the projects are spread across various technology like
network virtualization, clustering, southbound device management and NFV use cases. I am also part of <a href="https://www.opendaylight.org/governance">OpenDaylight Technical Steering Committee (TSC)</a> and <a href="https://www.opendaylight.org/leadership">OpenDaylight Board</a>. Prior to joining Brocade, I was working with IBM
Research, where I was conducting research in the SDN & Cloud technology domain for more than half a decade. I am
passionate about disruptive networking technologies and prefers to contribute to these technologies through Open Source
initiatives.

Apart from designing/developing code, i keep trying to improve my photography skills, mainly focussing on landscape,
wild-life and portrait photography.
